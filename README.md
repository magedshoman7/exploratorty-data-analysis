#  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Traffic Dataset

This code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a traffic dataset, aimed at providing insights into the traffic data and identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data. The dataset contains traffic data that has been collected over a period of time.

The code uses Python and its data manipulation and visualization libraries, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly, to perform the EDA. The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a pandas dataframe. It then proceeds to perform data cleaning, which includes handling missing values, data type conversion, and removing duplicates.

After cleaning the data, the code then proceeds to perform exploratory analysis, which includes statistical analysis, data visualization, and correlation analysis. The code generates descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance, as well as frequency distribution tables and histograms for each variable in the dataset.

Furthermore, the code generates different types of visualizations, such as line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps, to help identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data. The code also performs correlation analysis to identify any significant relationships between variables in the dataset.


We start by defining a class named 'dataproc', which contains some methods for processing traffic data. The class has three methods:

*read_csv_format()*: This method reads a CSV file from the given path and converts the 'datetime' column to datetime format. It returns the resulting dataframe.

*pick_random()*: This method selects a random number of detectors (specified by the 'n' variable in the class's init method) from the given CSV file and returns the resulting dataframe.

*split_data()*: This method takes a dataframe and splits it into two dataframes based on two given days (specified by the 'days' variable in the class's init method). It filters the data based on hour between 6am and 8pm and returns two dataframes.

The code also creates an instance of the 'dataproc' class with a path to a CSV file as an argument. It then calls the 'pick_random' method to select a random number of detectors and stores the resulting dataframe in the variable 'df'. It then calls the 'visualize' method to plot a histogram of the 'occupancy' column and a line graph of 'datetime' against 'occupancy'. Finally, it calls the 'split_data' method to split the 'df' dataframe into two dataframes based on the 'days' variable and stores the resulting dataframes in 'df1' and 'df2'.
